% move(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) solves the Towers of Hanoi problem
% for N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary as the auxiliary peg.

% Base case: moving 1 disk from Source to Destination.
move(1, Source, Destination, _) :-
    write('Move disk from '),
    write(Source),
    write(' to '),
    write(Destination),
    nl.

% Recursive case: moving N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary.
move(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, Source, Auxiliary, Destination),
    move(1, Source, Destination, _),
    move(M, Auxiliary, Destination, Source).

% Query to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem for a given number of disks.
hanoi(N) :-
    move(N, left, right, center).
